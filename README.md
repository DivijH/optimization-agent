## Shopping Agent

An AI-powered Etsy shopping agent that autonomously browses and analyzes products based on a given task and persona. The agent uses browser automation to search for products, analyze product pages, and make informed shopping decisions. The personas, gathered from the paper [UXAgent: An LLM Agent-Based Usability Testing Framework for Web Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12561), are located at `data/personas`.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd src
python shopping_agent.py --task "buy a large, inflatable spider decoration for halloween"
```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API key**:
   ```bash
   echo "your-api-key-here" > src/keys/litellm.key
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "your shopping task here"
```

### All Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--task` | `"buy a large, inflatable spider decoration for halloween"` | The shopping task for the agent |
| `--persona` | Michael (42yo marketing manager) | The persona for the agent |
| `--config-file` | *None* | Path to a JSON file containing `task` and `persona`. Values in the file override the flags above |
| `--manual` | False | Wait for user to press Enter after each agent action |
| `--headless` | False | Run the browser in headless mode |
| `--max-steps` | 10 | Maximum number of steps the agent will take |
| `--debug-path` | `"debug_run"` | Path to save debug artifacts (screenshots, logs) |
| `--width` | 1920 | Browser viewport width |
| `--height` | 1080 | Browser viewport height |
| `--n-products` | 3 | Number of products to analyze (-1 for all) |
| `--model` | `"gpt-4o-mini"` | LLM model name (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini) |
| `--temperature` | 0.7 | LLM sampling temperature (0-2) |
| `--record-video` | False | Record browser session video (requires ffmpeg) |

### Examples

**Simple task**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "find a handmade ceramic mug"
```

**With custom persona**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "buy a birthday gift" --persona "Sarah, a 28-year-old graphic designer who loves minimalist design"
```

**Debug mode with manual control**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "find vintage jewelry" --manual --debug-path "my_debug_run"
```

**Headless mode with video recording**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "buy art supplies" --headless --record-video --max-steps 20
```

**Custom model and temperature**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --task "find a wedding gift" --model "gpt-4o" --temperature 0.3
```

**Using a JSON config file**:
```bash
python shopping_agent.py --config-file my_shopping_task.json
```

## How It Works

1. **Task Breakdown**: Breaks your shopping task into specific search queries
2. **Product Discovery**: Searches Etsy and identifies relevant products
3. **Visual Selection**: Uses screenshots + LLM to choose the most promising listings
4. **Product Analysis**: Summarises pros/cons for each product page
5. **Memory Management**: Remembers analysed products to avoid duplicates
6. **Decision Making**: Generates the final purchase recommendation based on memory

## Output

- **Console**: Real-time progress and decision logs
- **Memory**: `_memory.json` with all analysed products & search history
- **Final Decision**: `_final_purchase_decision.json` with the LLM's recommendation
- **Debug Files**: Step-by-step JSON logs and screenshots (if `--debug-path` is set)
- **Video**: `session.mp4` recording (if `--record-video` is enabled)

## Key Features

- **Task Decomposition**: Automatically breaks high-level shopping goals into smaller sub-tasks using an LLM.
- **Visual Product Selection**: Captures screenshots of search results and lets a multimodal LLM decide which listing to open next.
- **In-Depth Product Analysis**: Scrolls through product pages, extracts text & images, and asks the LLM to summarise pros, cons, and a short description.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores analysed products and search queries to avoid duplicates and provide context for future decisions.
- **Final Recommendation**: After exploring, the agent uses its memory to output a JSON purchase recommendation.
- **Rich Debug Artefacts**: Saves JSON logs and annotated/plain screenshots for every step to the folder specified by `--debug-path`.
- **Screen Recording (optional)**: Record the entire browser session to MP4 with `--record-video` (requires ffmpeg).
- **Interactive Mode**: Add `--manual` to pause after every action so you can inspect what the agent is doing.

### Prerequisites for Screen Recording

The `--record-video` flag relies on **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** being installed and available in your `PATH`. On macOS you can install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

‚ö†Ô∏è  `--record-video` and `--headless` cannot be used together ‚Äì the script will exit with an error if both flags are supplied.

## Using a JSON Config File

Passing large persona descriptions via the command line can get messy. Instead, place them in a small JSON file:

```json
{
  "intent": "buy a pair of Jobst zipper compression socks for women.",
  "persona": "Persona: Sophia\n\nBackground:\nSophia is a dedicated community college professor with a deep passion for education and empowering underserved students. She has spent the past two decades sharing her expertise and inspiring young minds to reach their full potential.\n\nDemographics:\nAge: 54\nGender: Female\nEducation: Master's degree in Education\nProfession: Community College Professor\nIncome: $65,000\n\nFinancial Situation:\nSophia's income as a community college professor provides her with a comfortable, yet modest, living.

Run the agent with:

```bash
python shopping_agent.py --config-file my_shopping_task.json
```

The values in the JSON file take precedence over any of the corresponding CLI flags.
