    "cons": ["Shipping will take 2 days, that might be a problem for gifts.", "There are just 3 reviews for this product, and since I am data-driven, I want the product to have more reviews."],
    "summary": "This is a good quality product for final purchase and I don't mind the price, but I need this as a gift, so shipping delays are not ideal. I also wish the product to have more reviews before I buy it."
